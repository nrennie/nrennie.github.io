      <description>In June, the #CottonViz data visualisation challenge was run by the History of Statistics &amp;amp; Young Statisticians sections of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS). The challenge aimed to celebrate the work of Mary Eleanor Spear (1897 –1986), credited with popularising the range-bar charts.
Reimagining Mary Eleanor Spear&amp;#39;s visualisation of US cotton supply for the #CotttonViz competition with @HistoryofStats and @statsyss. First time using the {ggpattern} package (great for colourblind-friendly visualisations).#DataVisualization #DataViz #RStats pic.</description>

Check out the challenge here. Note that the text in the visualisations is taken from the original charts and uses antiquated terms to refer to populations of colour.
