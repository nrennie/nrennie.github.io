      <description>One of my goals for 2021 was to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge on a regular basis. This blog post reflects on the past year of data visualisations.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, #TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more here.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, whilst curating for @ WeAreRLadies, I tweeted a thread on my thought process for this week&amp;rsquo;s #TidyTuesday challenge. This blog post expands on the thoughts in this aforementioned thread:
It can be a little bit scary to make your first (or any) contribution to #TidyTuesday on twitter so I thought I’d outline my thought process for this week’s Spice Girls data. pic.twitter.com/zsyV3mfRkG

      <description>The #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping, cartography, and data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community. Every day in November participants create a map with a given theme (e.g. population, monochrome, raster) and share their results Twitter using the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag. Check out the challenge here.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating data visualisations for a while, I don&amp;rsquo;t normally have that many opportunities to work with spatial data. This year, I created all 30 maps (see below).</description>
