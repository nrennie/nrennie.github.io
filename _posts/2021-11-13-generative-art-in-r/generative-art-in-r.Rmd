Generative art refers to algorithmically determined computer generated artwork. To share my generative art (and to practice building an R package from scratch) I developed an R package called aRt which is available on GitHub at: [github.com/nrennie/aRt](https://github.com/nrennie/aRt).

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="49%",fig.show='hold'} 
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/circular_n10.jpeg", "images/vortex_n25_r.jpeg"))  
```
```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%",out.height="49%",fig.show='hold'} 
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/boxes_n100_p1.jpeg", "images/bullseye_1234.jpeg"))  
```
