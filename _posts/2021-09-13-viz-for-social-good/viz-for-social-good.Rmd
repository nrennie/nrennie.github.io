## Sunny Street

Sunny Street is changing the world by providing healthcare to the most vulnerable people in Eastern Australia. One conversation between a Sunny Street volunteer and a patient can change the course of both of their lives.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="75%",out.height="75%",fig.show='hold', fig.align="center"} 
knitr::include_graphics(c("images/sunny_street.png"))  
```

Although the Covid-19 pandemic caused many clinics to be cancelled, Sunny Street volunteers had the same (or more) conversations and consultations. There has been little change in patient demographic throughout the pandemic.
