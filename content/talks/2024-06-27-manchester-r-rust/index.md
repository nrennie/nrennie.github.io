“My R code is slow”. It’s a common complaint, especially when data sets get bigger and models get more complex. Although there are many methods for optimising R code, sometimes you need to rewrite especially slow operations in another programming language. One of those languages might be Rust. This talk will demonstrate rewriting functions in Rust, calling Rust functions from R, and show a comparison of speed when using Rust for vectorising operations in R.
