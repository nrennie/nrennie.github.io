### Abstract

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system. Quarto allows you to weave together narrative text and code to produce elegantly formatted output and tell a story. When the underlying data inevitably changes, a click of a button will update the document like magic â€“ automatically updating plots, tables and text. This style of automated reporting makes data analysis more efficient and reproducible. Quarto supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, slides, dashboards, scientific articles and more.

By the end of the workshop you will be able to:

- use Markdown formatting to customise a document
- embed R code into a Quarto report
- dynamically embed plots and tables

The resources for this workshop are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/jumpingrivers/RSS-reproducible-data-reports-with-Quarto).
