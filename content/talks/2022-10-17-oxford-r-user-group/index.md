### Abstract

Quarto is an open-source scientific and technical publishing system, developed by RStudio (Posit). By combining narrative text, code, images, and tables, Quarto allows you to produce elegantly formatted output that is fully reproducible. Quarto is capable of embedding code written in R, Python, Julia, and Observable (for this talk we'll focus on R). It supports dozens of static and dynamic output formats including HTML, PDF, MS Word, slides, dashboards, scientific articles and more.

In this talk, I'll discuss what Quarto is and how it differs from R Markdown, demonstrate how to make simple documents, and showcase a few features of Quarto that make it incredibly useful.

The source code for the slides can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/talks/tree/main/2022/2022-10-Oxford-R-User-Group).
