As part of the parallel sessions section, I will deliver a short presentation on the use of data visualisation in OR before we open the floor to the roundtable discussion.

## Abstract

Data visualisation can be a very efficient method of identifying patterns in data and communicating results to broad audiences. Good data visualisation requires both creativity and careful consideration of the technical details. In this session, we’ll present guidelines for creating more effective visualisations and demonstrate ways in which charts can be designed to convey information more accurately. In the following roundtable discussion, participants will have the opportunity to debate whether those guidelines are always applicable and consider special cases where they may not be, as well as discuss ways in which they can improve their own data visualisations.
