## Abstract

Multilingual shiny apps are not straightforward to build. Translation affects almost every single aspect of an app. Although there are a few packages designed to automate the translation process, they tend to only work for the most widely spoken languages.
Using a bilingual shiny app [Jumping Rivers](https://www.jumpingrivers.com/) developed as a case study, this talk will discuss:

* how we built a multilingual shiny app;
* how translation affected design decisions;
* how we overcame the main issues faced;
* and most importantly, what we'd do differently next time.

By the end of this talk, you will have a better understanding of how to translate your Shiny app to help you to share your app with a much wider audience.
