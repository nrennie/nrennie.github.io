I recently gave a talk to [R-Ladies Nairobi](https://twitter.com/rladiesnairobi), where I discussed the #30DayChartChallenge. In the second half of my [talk](https://nrennie.rbind.io/talks/2022-may-rladies-nairobi/), I demonstrated how I created the Goldilocks Decision Tree flowchart using {igraph} and {ggplot2}. This blog post tries to capture that process in words.

Flowcharts can be a useful way to visualise complex processes. Although the example here is rather trivial and created purely for fun, nonetheless flowcharts have been a useful part of data visualistaion in my work.

### Packages for making flowcharts in R

Having previously exclusively used tools like MS Visio for creating flowcharts, using R for the same thing was new to me. Before creating flowcharts from scratch using {ggplot2}, I explored a few other packages to see if they would do what I wanted.

* {grid}: for drawing simple grobs e.g., rectangles, lines
* {DiagrammeR}: interface to the DOT language
* {igraph}: package for working with graph objects
* {ggnetwork}, {ggnet2}, and {ggraph}: packages for working with and plotting network data
* {tikz}: (okay, this is actually a LaTex package for flowcharts but you *can* write LaTeX in R!)

None of these packages did *quite* what I was looking for - a programmatic way of creating highly customisable, good looking flowcharts in R. In essence, flowcharts are just rectangles, text, and arrows. And since {ggplot2} is capable of building all three of those things, so I decided to use it build a flowchart. This blog post illustrates the process of doing so.

### R packages required

I used four packages in creating the flowchart (technically more, since {tidyverse} is a collection of packages!). The {showtext} package is used for fonts, and {rcartocolor} for the colour palettes. Therefore, these are not necessary packages for building a generic non-styled flowchart.

``` r
library(tidyverse)
library(igraph)
library(showtext)
library(rcartocolor)
```
### The building blocks for flowcharts

The first step in building the flowchart was to create data frames (or tibbles) of the information I would need to construct the rectangles, text, and arrows in the chart.

#### Creating the initial data set

The input data required is a data frame with two columns specifying the start and end points of the arrows in my chart. I constructed it manually by writing out a tibble, but you could alternatively store this information in a .csv file, for example.

``` r
goldilocks <- tibble(from = c("Goldilocks",
                              "Porridge", "Porridge", "Porridge",
                              "Just right",
                              "Chairs", "Chairs", "Chairs",
                              "Just right2",
                              "Beds", "Beds", "Beds",
                              "Just right3"),
                     to = c("Porridge",
                            "Too cold", "Too hot", "Just right",
                            "Chairs",
                            "Still too big", "Too big", "Just right2",
                            "Beds",
                            "Too soft", "Too hard", "Just right3",
                            "Bears!"))
```

This is what the data should look like: 

``` r
# A tibble: 6 Ã— 2
  from       to           
  <chr>      <chr>        
1 Goldilocks Porridge     
2 Porridge   Too cold     
3 Porridge   Too hot      
4 Porridge   Just right   
5 Just right Chairs       
6 Chairs     Still too big
```

One key thing to note here, is that each node in my flowchart must have a unique name. There are a couple of nodes which will have the same text labels, but the node names must be different. Hence, the variables `"Just right"`, `"Just right2"`, and `"Just right3"`.

#### Defining the layout

I initially toyed with the idea of writing my own code to define the layout of the nodes. However, the {igraph} package actually did what I wanted. Flowcharts are essentially tree graphs, and the `layout_as_tree()` function constructs a tree layout of an input graph.

``` r
g = graph_from_data_frame(goldilocks, directed = TRUE)
coords = layout_as_tree(g)
colnames(coords) = c("x", "y")
```
The returns a data frame of x and y coordinates for the centre points of the node locations:

``` r
      x y
[1,]  0 7
[2,]  0 6
[3,] -1 5
[4,] -1 4
[5,] -2 3
[6,] -2 2
```

#### Adding attributes

The `coords` data will become my main data set relating to the rectangles. Currently, it contains only the x and y coordinates of the centre of the rectangle. After converting my data frame to a tibble, I add some additional information. Using the `vertex_attr()` function, I add the names of the nodes from the original `goldilocks` tibble. 

I use a regex to remove the appended numbers from the names, and create the labels that will actually appear in my flowchart.

I also multiply the x-coordinates by -1. This reverse the plotting from a top-right -- bottom-left direction, to become a top-left -- bottom-right direction. Although I could have used something like `scale_x_reverse()` at a later stage, when I was working out how to construct the coordinates, I found it easier to think about the data without accounting for future transformations. Finally, I add a `type` variable, to classify the nodes into actions, decisions, and outcomes. I'll later colour the rectangles based on `type`.

``` r
output_df = as_tibble(coords) %>%
  mutate(step = vertex_attr(g, "name"),
         label = gsub("\\d+$", "", step),
         x = x*-1,
         type = factor(c(1, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1)))
```

``` r
# A tibble: 6 Ã— 5
      x     y step        type  label     
  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>       <fct> <chr>     
1     0     7 Goldilocks  1     Goldilocks
2     0     6 Porridge    2     Porridge  
3     1     5 Just right  3     Just right
4     1     4 Chairs      2     Chairs    
5     2     3 Just right2 3     Just right
6     2     2 Beds        2     Beds   
```

#### Making the boxes

The columns in `output_df` give me the x and y coordinates of the centre of the nodes. I'm going to use `geom_rect()` from {ggplot2} to plot the rectangles, and it requires four arguments: `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin` and `ymax` - essentially specifying the coordinates of the corners of the boxes. I use `mutate()` from {dplyr} to created new columns, specifying how far away the top, bottom, left, and right of the rectangles should be from the center. It took a little bit of trial and error to find the correct values here.

``` r
plot_nodes = output_df %>%
  mutate(xmin = x - 0.35,
         xmax = x + 0.35,
         ymin = y - 0.25,
         ymax = y + 0.25)
```
Now `plot_nodes` tibble looks like this:

``` r
# A tibble: 6 Ã— 9
      x     y step        type  label       xmin  xmax  ymin  ymax
  <dbl> <dbl> <chr>       <fct> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl> <dbl> <dbl>
1     0     7 Goldilocks  1     Goldilocks -0.35  0.35  6.75  7.25
2     0     6 Porridge    2     Porridge   -0.35  0.35  5.75  6.25
3     1     5 Just right  3     Just right  0.65  1.35  4.75  5.25
4     1     4 Chairs      2     Chairs      0.65  1.35  3.75  4.25
5     2     3 Just right2 3     Just right  1.65  2.35  2.75  3.25
6     2     2 Beds        2     Beds        1.65  2.35  1.75  2.25
```

#### Making the edges

I need to adapt the original `goldilocks` tibble, to include the information on the x and y coordinates of the start and end point of the arrows. This step took a lot of experimenting before I got it right. First, I added an `id` column based on row number which later helped me keep track of which elements relate to which arrow. I use `pivot_longer()` from {tidyr} to put my data into long format - now each row relates to a single coordinate point. 

The `left_join()` function from {dplyr} is then used to match up these coordinates to the rectangle the arrow will start or end at. Here, `select()` is used solely for tidying up purposes to get rid of the columns I no longer need. 

The x-coordinates of my arrows will always start from the horizontal centre of the rectangle, so I can use the existing x-coordinates of the rectangles for this. The y-coordinate is a little trickier. The y-coordinate of the arrow endpoint depends if it's the "from" or the "to" part of the arrow. Arrows leaving a rectangle should leave from the bottom of the rectangle - the `"ymin"` value. Arrows arriving at a rectangle should arrive at the top of the rectangle - the `"ymax"` value. A combination of `mutate()` and `ifelse()` constructs the y-coordinates.

``` r
plot_edges = goldilocks %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c("from", "to"),
               names_to = "s_e",
               values_to = "step") %>%
  left_join(plot_nodes, by = "step") %>%
  select(-c(label, type, y, xmin, xmax)) %>%
  mutate(y = ifelse(s_e == "from", ymin, ymax)) %>%
  select(-c(ymin, ymax))
```

``` r
# A tibble: 6 Ã— 5
     id s_e   step           x     y
  <int> <chr> <chr>      <dbl> <dbl>
1     1 from  Goldilocks     0  6.75
2     1 to    Porridge       0  6.25
3     2 from  Porridge       0  5.75
4     2 to    Too cold       0  5.25
5     3 from  Porridge       0  5.75
6     3 to    Too hot       -1  5.25
```

### Plotting a flowchart with {ggplot2}

There are three main components to flowcharts: rectangles, text, and arrows. I'll add these components as different layers with {ggplot2}. First up - rectangles:

#### Drawing rectangles

``` r
p = ggplot() +
  geom_rect(data = plot_nodes,
            mapping = aes(xmin = xmin, ymin = ymin, 
                          xmax = xmax, ymax = ymax, 
                          fill = type, colour = type),
            alpha = 0.5) 
```
I pass in the `xmin`, `xmax`, `ymin` and `ymax` values defined earlier in the `plot_nodes` tibble to `geom_rect()`, and colour the rectangles based on the `type` variable. I also make the boxes slightly transparent.

</p>

#### Adding labels and choosing fonts

Before I add the text labels, I need to choose what font I want to use. Although the default font would work well for simpler flowcharts, for this example I want to choose a fun font! There are a few different R packages for working with fonts (including {extrafont} and {ragg}). My preference is the {showtext} package as I've found it the easiest to use, and it works in the same way on both Linux and Windows OS. I also like the fact that it works with Google fonts. I can visually browse through these fonts at [fonts.google.com](https://fonts.google.com/), which reduces the trial and error of finding a font I like.

For this flowchart, I settled on the *Henny Penny* font from Google - it gives off fairy tale vibes to me! I load it into R using the `font_add_google()` function, giving the official name and the name I will use to refer to the font in R as arguments. Running `showtext_auto()` is an important step as it makes the loaded fonts available to R.

``` r
font_add_google(name = "Henny Penny", family = "henny")
showtext_auto()
```
I can then add text labels to my flowchart with `geom_text()`, specifying the font and colour.

``` r
p = p + 
  geom_text(data = plot_nodes,
            mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, label = label),
            family = "henny",
            color = "#585c45") 
```

<p align="center">
<img width = "80%" src="/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/plot1b.png?raw=true">
</p>

#### Drawing the arrows

The arrows are drawn using `geom_path()`. It's important that I use `geom_path()` instead of `geom_line()` since I don't want {ggplot2} to re-order the arrows based on their x-coordinates. I also specify the `group` variable to ensure that each arrow is only drawn between two points, instead of all connected to each other. 

The arrowheads are specified using the `arrow` argument and `arrow()` function. Again, it took a little bit of trial and error to find the right size of arrowhead. 

``` r
p = p + 
  geom_path(data = plot_edges,
            mapping = aes(x = x, y = y, group = id),
            colour = "#585c45",
            arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.3, "cm"), type = "closed"))
```

<p align="center">
<img width = "80%" src="/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/plot1c.png?raw=true">
</p>

#### Colour schemes

We now have the basic flowchart constructed and it's time to start styling it - this is my favourite part! Instead of the default colour palette used by {ggplot2}, I'm going to use a palette from the {rcartocolor} package called `"Antique"`. You can browse the palettes in this package at [jakubnowosad.com/rcartocolor](https://jakubnowosad.com/rcartocolor/). I change both the outline and inner colour of the rectangles to have the same colours.

``` r
p = p + 
  scale_fill_carto_d(palette = "Antique") +
  scale_colour_carto_d(palette = "Antique")
```

<p align="center">
<img width = "80%" src="/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/plot2.png?raw=true">
</p>

#### Adding text

The next step is adding a title and caption using the `labs()` function. In the caption, I usually include my name, the data source, and (in this case) the source of the image I will add later.

``` r
p = p + 
  labs(title = "The Goldilocks Decision Tree",
       caption = "N. Rennie\n\nData: Robert Southey. Goldilocks and the Three Bears. 
       1837.\n\nImage: New York Public Library\n\n#30DayChartChallenge") 
```
<p align="center">
<img width = "80%" src="/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/plot3.png?raw=true">
</p>

#### Editing themes

The final aesthetic changes are done using the `theme()` function - this lets you control the look of all the non-data elements of your plot. The first thing I change is the background colour. I chose the background colour based on the image I want to overlay later. For reference, I browsed for images with a creative commons licence and found this one from the New York Public Library.

<p align="center">
<img width = "80%" src="/blog/2022-06-06-creating-flowcharts-with-ggplot2/img.jpg?raw=true">
</p>

I used [imagecolorpicker.com](https://imagecolorpicker.com/en) to extract the hex code of the background colour of the image and then set the plot background to be the same. There are two elements to changing the background colour: `panel.background` and `plot.background`. The `panel.background` argument changes the colour of the area behind the plotted data (grey by default). The `plot.background` argument changes the colour of the area around the plot (white by default).

Here, I also use `theme_void()` to remove all axis labels, titles, ticks, and gridlines. Unfortunately, this also removes the space around the edge of the plot, so I add it back in using the `plot.margin` argument. I also remove the legend in this example by setting `legend.position = "none"`.

Finally, I style the title and caption text, and use the same font as I did for the rectangle labels.

``` r
p = p + 
  theme_void() +
  theme(plot.margin = unit(c(1, 1, 0.5, 1), "cm"),
        legend.position = "none",
        plot.background = element_rect(colour = "#f2e4c1", fill = "#f2e4c1"),
        panel.background = element_rect(colour = "#f2e4c1", fill = "#f2e4c1"),
        plot.title = element_text(family = "henny", hjust = 0, face = "bold",
                                  size = 40, color = "#585c45",
                                  margin = margin(t = 10, r = 0, b = 10, l = 0)),
        plot.caption = element_text(family = "henny", hjust = 0,
                                    size = 10, color = "#585c45",
                                    margin = margin(t = 10)))
```

</p>

#### Adding images

There are a few different packages in R that are capable of adding images on top of plots. I most commonly use a combination of {magick} and {cowplot}. However, in this instance, I actually used [Inkscape.org](https://inkscape.org/release/inkscape-1.2/), a free, open-source image editing tool, instead. The process of adding the image on top of my plot, and arranging it exactly where I wanted, was much simpler and faster using Inkscape rather than R in this case.

And that gives us the final image:

Hopefully, this tutorial blog demonstrated the process of creating a flowchart in R using {igraph} and {ggplot2}, and encourages you to create your own!
