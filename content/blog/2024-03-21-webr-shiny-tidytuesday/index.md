A Shiny app that automatically updates every week without the need to re-deploy it? Without the need to host a server running R? Sound too good to be true? It's not. Read on for an overview of how I built a Shiny app to browse and display my #TidyTuesday plots, which automatically updates every time I make a new plot.

## What is #TidyTuesday?

For those of you who don't know, #TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more on [GitHub](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday). 

Over the past three years or so, I've created around 150 visualisations and I wanted some way of showcasing the work I'd done. Of course, the code and images are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday) but it's not the nicest interface for browsing plots. I've also added some to my website, but it only shows the highlights - not hundreds of plots!

What I wanted was:

* an app that displays every #TidyTuesday plot I've created
* with functionality to search by packages used in creating the plots
* and links to the original code and data
* that updates by itself whenever I create a new plot
* and is free and easy to deploy

## Collecting the data

In order to display every plot I've created, the first thing I needed to do was get a list of all those plots. Luckily, all of the plots and their source code is stored in a nicely structured way on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday).

> The blog post I wrote about [Creating template files in R ](https://nrennie.rbind.io/blog/script-templates-r/) and using them for #TidyTuesday code, explains how I enforced a particular structure to keep it consistent over the years.* 

In particular, each image is stored in the GitHub repository with a name of the following form `/yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd/yyyymmdd.png`.* In each `yyyy/yyyy-mm-dd` folder there is also an R script titled `yyyymmdd.R` and a `README.md` file where the first line is always `<h1 align="center">Name of Plot</h1>`. The R for Data Science [GitHub repository](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) that provides the data also uses a date-based structure. Almost all of the meta data that we need for the plot is contained within the structure of the folders and files.

* except 2021 where I had the horrific `dd-mm-yyyy` date format instead of the `yyyy-mm-dd` format that we all know is best.

Let's start by getting a 

```r
# get list of all #tidytuesday folders
all_folders <- tibble::tibble(
  folders = list.dirs(path = ".", recursive = TRUE)
)

# get list of all weeks
all_weeks <- all_folders |>
  mutate(folders = str_remove(folders, "./")) |>
  separate_wider_delim(
    folders,
    delim = "/",
    names = c("year", "week"),
    too_few = "align_start",
    too_many = "drop"
  ) |>
  filter(year %in% c(2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024)) |>
  drop_na(week) |>
  mutate(
    title = NA_character_,
    pkgs = NA_character_,
    code_fpath = NA_character_,
    img_fpath = NA_character_
  )
```

For each, ... we can extract the plot name from the first line of the `README.md` file:

```r
# utils function
str_extract_between <- function(x, start, end) {
  pattern <- paste0("(?<=", start, ")(.*?)(?=", end, ")")
  return(stringr::str_extract(x, pattern = pattern))
}

# find README file
tt_readme <- list.files(file.path(tt_week$year, tt_week$week, "/"),
      pattern = "\\.md|\\.MD", full.names = TRUE
    )
# read README file
    readme_txt <- readLines(tt_readme, warn = FALSE)[1]
# extract title
readme_title <- str_extract_between(readme_txt, start = ">", end = "<") |>
stringr::str_trim("both")
```

To be able to browse by packages


You can view the complete `make-data.R` script on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/blob/main/data/make-data.R).

## Automatically updating the data

This data is based on all plots that currently exist in the `tidytuesday` repository. That means that when I create a new plot next week, the data becomes out of date. I *could* manually re-run my `make-data.R` each week. Or I could get GitHub to do it for me without asking. How? Via [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that allows you to automate your build, test, and deployment pipeline. That means you can write a GitHub Actions workflow that runs the `make-data.R` script every time you push to main on GitHub i.e. every time I add a new plot.

Inside the `tidytuesday` repository, we create a folder called `.github/workflows`, and we create a file called `update-data.yml`. The name of the file doesnâ€™t really matter, just that the file type is `.yml`, since this is how we write a workflow for GitHub Actions. The first part of the workflow is fairly standard:

```yaml
name: Update data

on:
   # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the main branch
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab
  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  update:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      GITHUB_PAT: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
        with:
          use-public-rspm: true
```

This tells GitHub when to run the action (every time we push to main or manually ask for it to be run). It also tells GitHub to run it using the latest version of Ubuntu, and install R.

The next part of the workflow installs the R packages needed for `make-data.R` to run, and then runs `make-data.R`.

```yaml
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: |
          install.packages(c("attachment", "dplyr", "tidyr", "stringr", "writexl"))
        shell: Rscript {0}
        
      - name: Update data
        run: |
          source("data/make-data.R")
        shell: Rscript {0}
```
Finally, we want to commit the `.xlsx` and `.RData` files back to the GitHub repository so that we can use them:

```yaml
      - name: Commit files
        run: |
          git config --local user.email "actions@github.com"
          git config --local user.name "GitHub Actions"
          git add --all
          git commit -am "add data" || exit 0
          git push 
```

The full GitHub Action workflow is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/blob/main/.github/workflows/update-data.yml). Make sure you also allow GitHub Actions to run in the Settings of your GitHub repository.

## Building a Shiny app

Shiny is an R package that makes it easier to build interactive web apps straight from R. If you haven't built a Shiny app before, the ... is a great place to start. This is going to be a very simple Shiny app with just a couple of user inputs, some text, and an image to display so I'm going to keep it simple and build it in a single `app.R` file. Let's start by loading the required packages and the data:

```r
library(shiny)
library(dplyr)
library(htmltools)
library(glue)
library(rlang)
library(shinythemes)

# Data
load(url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/main/data/all_weeks.RData"))

# Get all plot titles and all packages used
all_titles <- all_weeks$title
all_pkgs <- dplyr::select(all_weeks, -c(year, week, title, pkgs, code_fpath, img_fpath))
all_pkgs <- colnames(all_pkgs)
```

Now we can build the UI:

```r
ui <- fluidPage(

  theme = shinytheme("superhero"),

  titlePanel("#TidyTuesday"),

  sidebarLayout(

    sidebarPanel(
      markdown("[Nicola Rennie](https://github.com/nrennie)

htmltools::hr(),
htmltools::tags$details(
  htmltools::tags$summary("Filter R packages (click to expand):"),
  shiny::radioButtons("pkg_select",
                      "Only show plots that use:",
                      choices = c("Any package", all_pkgs),
                      selected = NULL,
                      inline = TRUE
  )
),
# choose a plot

And the server component:

```r
server <- function(input, output) {
  # Get data
  all_titles <- reactive({
    req(input$pkg_select)
    if (input$pkg_select == "Any package") {
      all_titles <- all_weeks$title
    } else {
      all_titles <- all_weeks %>%
        dplyr::filter(!!rlang::sym(input$pkg_select) == 1) %>%
        dplyr::pull(title)
    }
  })

  # Select title
  output$select_img <- renderUI({
    shiny::selectInput("plot_title",
                       "Select a plot:",
                       choices = rev(all_titles()),
                       width = "90%"
    )
  })

  # Get data
  week_data <- reactive({
    req(input$plot_title)
    dplyr::filter(all_weeks, title == input$plot_title)
  })

  ## Image display
  img_path <- shiny::reactive({
    glue::glue("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/main/{week_data()$img_fpath}")
  })

  output$plot_img <- shiny::renderText({
    c('<img src="', img_path(), '" width="100%">')
  })

  ### List of packages
  output$pkgs_used <- shiny::renderText({
    glue::glue(
      "This plot uses the following packages: {week_data()$pkgs}"
    )
  })

  ### Code link
  code_path <- shiny::reactive({
    glue::glue(
      "https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday/tree/main/{week_data()$code_fpath}"
    )
  })

  output$code_link <- shiny::renderText({
    glue::glue(
      '<b>Code is available at</b>: <a href="{code_path()}"  target="_blank">{code_path()}</a>.'
    )
  })

  ### R4DS link
  r4ds_path <- shiny::reactive({
    if (week_data()$year == "2021") {
      reformat_week <- as.character(as.Date(week_data()$week, format = "%d-%m-%Y"))
      glue::glue(
        "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/{week_data()$year}/{reformat_week}/readme.md"
      )
    } else {
      glue::glue(
        "https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/{week_data()$year}/{week_data()$week}/readme.md"
      )
    }
  })

  output$r4ds_link <- shiny::renderText({
    glue::glue('<b>R4DS GitHub link</b>: <a href="{r4ds_path()}"  target="_blank">{r4ds_path()}</a>.')
  })
}
```

stick it all together

```r
shinyApp(ui = ui, server = server)
```

The source code for the app can be viewed on [GitHub](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday-shiny-app/tree/main/app).

## Deploying the Shiny app

Now we need to think about how to get the Shiny app off our laptops and out into the world. There are numerous ways to deploy Shiny apps - for example to [shinyapp.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/). The way that deployment approaches work is that the server and the client are separate: the shinyapps.io server runs the R code, and clients connect via a web browser. With the free tier of shinyapps.io, we're limited to how many apps and how much time we can use those servers for. What if the server and the client weren't separate?

[Shinylive (for R)](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) is a method of deployment where apps run entirely in the clientâ€™s web browser, without the need for a separate server running R. This is all thanks to [webR](https://docs.r-wasm.org/webr/latest/) - a version of R compiled for web browsers and Node.js using WebAssembly. WebR makes it possible to run R code in a web browser without the need for an R server. There are currently still some limitations of using shinylive - mainly the slower initial load time, and the fact that not all R packages can be used with webR. But many can, including all the ones we need for this Shiny app!

After installing the `shinylive` R package, we need to run:

```r
shinylive::export("app", "docs")
```
Assuming that the `app.R` file is stored in a folder called `app`, this converts your app into a Shinylive app and sticks it into a folder called `docs`. You can call these folders anything you like, I've picked `docs` because this is one of the special names recognised by [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). 

Then you can push all of the app code (including the `docs` folder) to GitHub. This could be in the same repository as the `tidytuesday` code, but to keep it cleaner I've put it in a separate [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nrennie/tidytuesday-shiny-app). To deploy using GitHub Pages, in your GitHub repository go to Settings -> Pages and select *Deploy from a branch* then choose `main/docs` as the source. Very soon you should see your Shinylive up and running! You can also deploy Shinylive to other static site hosting services if you'd prefer.

Since the R code is running in the web browser, and everything in the app is created using R code based on the input data, we don't need to re-deploy the app each week. It will update itself every time the data updates. You can view the app at [nrennie.rbind.io/tidytuesday-shiny-app](https://nrennie.rbind.io/tidytuesday-shiny-app/), though remember it does take a bit longer to load initially (better on a desktop than mobile!)

## Further resources

If you want to learn more about webR and Shinylive:

* This tutorial from Rami Krispin on how to [Deploy a Shinylive R App on Github Pages](https://github.com/RamiKrispin/shinylive-r) is an excellent introduction that walks you through the process in more detail than I've covered here.

* The [shinylive documentation](https://posit-dev.github.io/r-shinylive/) is also a good reference to have when creating your first Shinylive app!
