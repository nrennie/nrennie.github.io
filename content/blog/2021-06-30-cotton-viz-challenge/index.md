In June, the #CottonViz data visualisation challenge was run by the History of Statistics & Young Statisticians sections of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS). The challenge aimed to celebrate the work of Mary Eleanor Spear (1897 â€“1986), credited with popularising the *range-bar* charts.

The challenge invited particpants to either recreate Spears' original visualisation of US cotton supply (shown below), or design a new visualisation of the same data.

The details of the challenge can be found on the [RSS website](https://rss.org.uk/news-publication/news-publications/2021/section-group-reports/mary-eleanor-spear-dataviz-competition-for-childre/). Prizes were available for:

* Most accurate recreation 
* Most creative
* Most innovative

I started by recreating the original viz using {ggplot2}. One of the things I really like about the original visualisation is the black and white nature of it. Instead, patterns are used to tell apart the bars, leading me to discover the {ggpattern} package in R.

I also made three other attempts at re-visualising the US cotton supply data. For my first visualisation I stayed similar to the original design and created a 2 x 1 plot, one an area plot and the other a line chart.

The other two attempts were both waffle plots. The first was a simple faceted waffle plot showing the number of bales of cotton per year and where it was distributed.

Although I liked the design of the first waffle plot, it wasn't overly creative and didn't reflect the *cotton* theme. So I decided to hand-draw some cotton bales (using Inkscape) and use these instead of tiles in my waffle plots. This plot won me an honourable mention from the judges.
