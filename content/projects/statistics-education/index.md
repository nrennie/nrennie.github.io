## RoSE Network

The [RoSE Network](https://www.rose-network.org/) (Researchers of Statistics Education) creates an open and inclusive space for multidisciplinary researchers and practitioners of statistics education globally to connect, learn, and collaborate, toward advancing statistics education research. Since September 2023, I've been co-leading the Statistics Software Special Interest Group, and part of the Communications team.

## RSS Teaching Statistics Network

The [Teaching Statistics Section](https://rss.org.uk/membership/rss-groups-and-committees/sections/teaching-statistics/) of the [Royal Statistical Society](https://rss.org.uk/) provides a platform to collate and disseminate ideas and best practice in the teaching of statistics in post-18 education, including higher education and professional training. Since October 2023, I've been a member of the RSS Teaching Statistics Section committee.
