      <description>Earlier this week, whilst curating for @ WeAreRLadies, I tweeted a thread on my thought process for this week&amp;rsquo;s #TidyTuesday challenge. This blog post expands on the thoughts in this aforementioned thread:
It can be a little bit scary to make your first (or any) contribution to #TidyTuesday on twitter so I thought I’d outline my thought process for this week’s Spice Girls data. pic.twitter.com/zsyV3mfRkG

      <description>The #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping, cartography, and data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community. Every day in November participants create a map with a given theme (e.g. population, monochrome, raster) and share their results Twitter using the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag. Check out the challenge here.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating data visualisations for a while, I don&amp;rsquo;t normally have that many opportunities to work with spatial data. This year, I created all 30 maps (see below).</description>

      <description>I recently completed my PhD at STOR-i CDT at Lancaster University. My thesis was titled &amp;ldquo;Detecting demand outliers in transport systems&amp;rdquo; and here I&amp;rsquo;ll (try to) give a brief overview of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last three years. The final version of my thesis can be found here.
What are demand outliers?     An outlier is generally considered an abnormal event that doesn&amp;rsquo;t fit with the pattern of events normally observed.</description>
