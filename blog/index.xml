      <description>In December 2020, I curated the twitter feed for @WeAreRLadies and shared my 280 character thoughts to over 25,000 followers. This blog post will share my thoughts on the experience, and hopefully encourage (and prepare) you to sign up as a curator yourself.

      <description>One of my goals for 2021 was to participate in the #TidyTuesday challenge on a regular basis. This blog post reflects on the past year of data visualisations.
For those of you who don&amp;rsquo;t know, #TidyTuesday is a weekly data challenge aimed at the R community. Every week a new dataset is posted alongside a chart or article related to that dataset, and ask participants explore the data. You can access the data and find out more here.</description>

      <description>Earlier this week, whilst curating for @ WeAreRLadies, I tweeted a thread on my thought process for this week&amp;rsquo;s #TidyTuesday challenge. This blog post expands on the thoughts in this aforementioned thread:
It can be a little bit scary to make your first (or any) contribution to #TidyTuesday on twitter so I thought Iâ€™d outline my thought process for this weekâ€™s Spice Girls data. pic.twitter.com/zsyV3mfRkG

      <description>The #30DayMapChallenge is a daily mapping, cartography, and data visualization challenge aimed at the spatial community. Every day in November participants create a map with a given theme (e.g. population, monochrome, raster) and share their results Twitter using the #30DayMapChallenge hashtag. Check out the challenge here.
Although I&amp;rsquo;ve been creating data visualisations for a while, I don&amp;rsquo;t normally have that many opportunities to work with spatial data. This year, I created all 30 maps (see below).</description>

      <description>I recently completed my PhD at STOR-i CDT at Lancaster University. My thesis was titled &amp;ldquo;Detecting demand outliers in transport systems&amp;rdquo; and here I&amp;rsquo;ll (try to) give a brief overview of the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done in the last three years. The final version of my thesis can be found here.
Super happy to announce that this morning I passed my PhD viva with no corrections. ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰Thank you to my examiners Dr.</description>

VFSG: Visualize Our Community     Non-profits around the world are driving positive social change but some of them lack the in-house resources to effectively tell their story with the data they have.

      <description>In June, the #CottonViz data visualisation challenge was run by the History of Statistics &amp;amp; Young Statisticians sections of the Royal Statistical Society (RSS). The challenge aimed to celebrate the work of Mary Eleanor Spear (1897 â€“1986), credited with popularising the range-bar charts.
Reimagining Mary Eleanor Spear&amp;#39;s visualisation of US cotton supply for the #CotttonViz competition with @HistoryofStats and @statsyss. First time using the {ggpattern} package (great for colourblind-friendly visualisations).#DataVisualization #DataViz #RStats pic.</description>
