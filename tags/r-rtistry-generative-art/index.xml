      <description>What is generative art?     Generative art is the process of creating artwork through a set of pre-determined rules often with an element of randomness. It is often termed rtistry or aRt when the art is created using the programming language R.
In October 2021, I started experimenting with generative art, and developed a R package. I also took part in #genuary2022, the challenge running in the month of January where generative artists create art based on a different prompt each day.</description>
